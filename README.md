# SYMATO CC
SYMATO CC is a crowd computing project that allows anyone to join and contribute to the preprocessing of Vietnamese Common Crawl data. By using our symato-contribute script, you can easily set up your local machine to start serving and contributing to the project.

## Requisition

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- A HuggingFace account for Pull Request submission.
- AWS Access Key & Secret Key for reading CommonCrawl repo, this is free to create (contact Symato if you don't have one).
- PEER_ADDR and SWARM_ADDR: register your contribution with Symato in Discord.
- A PC/Laptop/VPS/Server that meets the minimum hardware requirements: at least 2 vCPUs, 2GB of RAM, and a stable internet connection.

## Get Started
To get started, youâ€™ll need to install the symato-contribute script and its dependencies on your local Linux/MacOS or WSL machine. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telexyz/cc/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The script requires sudo permission to install the following tools:

- Bacalhau Binary: This tool is used for distributed jobs.
- Docker: This tool provides an isolated execution environment.
- AWS CLI: This tool is required for quick access to the CommonCrawl data via the S3 protocol, as required by Bacalhau.
- `jq` and `unzip`: To unzip AWS and extract response from remote server.

## Start Serving
Once you have installed the symato-contribute script and its dependencies, you can start serving and contributing to the project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo symato-contribute
```

You will need to enter Huggingface Token, find it at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

This will start the SYMATO CC crowd computing process on your local machine. You can now contribute to the preprocessing of Vietnamese Common Crawl data.

Thank you for joining and contributing to SYMATO CC!
